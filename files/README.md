Having the RPM file in here is a little nasty, but it means we'll always be able to get going if needed. (Same for riaknostic)

Updated RPM's can be grabbed from [Basho's site](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/rhel-centos/).

Riaknostic you can get from [Basho's site](http://riaknostic.basho.com/) as well:

    wget https://github.com/basho/riaknostic/downloads/riaknostic-1.0.2.tar.gz
